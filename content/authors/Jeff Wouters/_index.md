I was born and raised in The Netherlands and I'm an IT geek with a passion for automation. At the young age of 6 I had my very first computer and started developing my own Pacman in order to learn Batch programming. Looking back the performance was terrible, but it worked. Over the years I always kept in touch with some sort of scripting or programming languages, such as Batch, (Turbo) Pascal, PHP, Delphi, Kixtart, Visual Basic Scripting (VBS), VB .NET, PowerShell and C# .NET(Core). I'm the owner of Methos, a consultancy and managed services company from The Netherlands focused on the Microsoft Modern Workplace (Windows + Intune + Office365) and Azure through automation and Infrastructure-as-Code.
