location: Microsoft Portugal HQ
address:
  street: Rua Fogo De Santelmo
  city: Lisbon
  country: Portugal

summary: 'In this talk I shared my experiences on building a team, not only looking at technical skills but mainly looking at soft-skills like communication and culture.'
abstract: 'See what I did there in the title? Did I just made DevOps a verb?! Yes, because it takes actual work. Over the years I’ve been to many customers helping them automate, script and work get the Operation teams to work with their developers, instead of making things ‘not their problem’. During this session I’ll take you with me on a 5+ year journey, building teams with a DevOps mindset, changing the behaviour of developers, it-professionals and even managers or project leaders. Stereo-types can be recognized, positioned, managed or used. All have their own strengths and with the right techniques and methods can empore the people around them. I’ll teach you techniques that will make you the key component between departments and enable you to facilitate change that will elevate your team, department or company to show an agile behaviour.'
