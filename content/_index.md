            As the founder and technical lead of the company I am responsible for everything, but I focus on the culture and technical direction.
            Regarding my preferred management style, there are a guidelines I adhere to:

            1) Sometimes it's the little things that matter. Someone's father was rushed to the hospital, their car broke down, they came back from vacation, when they just bought a house or it's their birthday.
            Send a cake/pie when someone has a birthday, send a post card when someone has a birthday or bought a house, or call them when they had unplanned work in the weekend and thank them for their work and ask them how they're doing. People tend to appreciate this, and it takes little effort to do it.

            2) Learn when to listen and when to respond. Sometimes people come to me with their problems or challenges. But not always they want me to provide a solution. Sometimes they just want to vent.

            3) Learn to delegate. There are only so many hours in a day, and days in a week. So in order to do more than you can accomplish just on your own, you'll need to delegate. Next to this, your employees/colleagues will probably value your trust and answer with their respect, or even loyalty.

            When it comes to fostering the culture of the company, here are the phrases that I try to always adhere by:

            1) Anything can be discussed, even passionately, but always respectfully. Try to respect the opinions, views and points of others, or at least understand them. You don't have to agree with them, naturally. But a bit of understanding goes a long way.

            2) Know your limits, and learn those of others. When you know your limits, you know where to invest for growth but also when and what what to delegate.
            
            3) Think before you act. Don't make hasty decisions, and especially not led by emotions. Take your time, and don't ever let external factors make you decide when you're not ready to make a decision. If there's ever a customer or colleague that tries to force you to make a hasty decision, chances are you'll end up drawing the short straw.

            Since this was a very interesting position, but the customer didn't hire externally, I decided to be employed again. After putting things on track and setting up a long term roadmap, my job was done and I left.

            For a second customer I was part of the team which handled to operational issues, like server deployment/configuration, solving incidents and general infrastructure problems. I had a personal project to solve issues on about 15 database clusters, based on the Windows Server 2003 (R2) platform with SQL Server and Oracle on it. The issues included unexplainable failovers, resources that could not come online on specific nodes, time skew errors, kerberos errors, etc.

          The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award is given by Microsoft to technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are awarded to people who actively share their technical expertise with different technology communities related directly or indirectly to Microsoft1. The MVP recognition lasts for a year and is awarded for a person’s Microsoft related activity, contributions, and influence over the previous year1.

          MVPs are not just technological experts with a deep understanding of Microsoft products and services. They’re also community leaders; someone who avidly shares their knowledge with the community, displaying exceptional leadership and a constant willingness to help others. They are always on the “bleeding edge” and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies3.

          In summary, being an MVP means a lot of passion to share knowledge and engage with the tech community.
